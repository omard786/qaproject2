# qaproject2
this is my 2nd project with qa 

About the project: 

getting started(requirments.txt)

roadmap:
There will be a total of 4 micro-services:

service 1 
this would be my random number generator the goal of this is to have 8 numbers generated randomly (1-8) 4 even and 4 odd numbers.

service 2 
this would be my random letter generator with 4 vowels (A,E,I,U) and 4 non-vowels (B,F,J,V)

service 3
this would bring the mixed string (8 random letter and numbers (4 of each)) together and then have the string pinned against a set criteria in order to win a prize.
the conditions would be as follows: 
2 even + 2 vowels = gold prize 
2 even + 1 vowel / 1 even + 2 vowels = silver prize 
2 even or 2 vowels = bronze prize 
1 even or 1 vowel = no prize ("you lose")

service 4 
this would be the front end i.e flask + html 

continous intergration: in order to present this i would need to have alternative string outputs for my variable genarators, ...
